# Random Quote Machine

The React project is a simple web application that generates random quotes and allows users to listen to them using text-to-speech functionality. It employs React hooks such as useState for state management and integrates with the Web Speech API through the react-speech-kit library. The application fetches quotes from a JSON file and dynamically changes the background color and text color with each new quote. Users can click a button to retrieve a new quote or trigger the text-to-speech feature to listen to the current quote and its author. The project showcases basic React concepts, state management, and integration with external libraries for enhanced user interaction.
